🧠 Chat App Dev – Master Thread (Daily Starter Prompt)

Context
I am building a real-time chat application.
Tech stack: React (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), MongoDB, Socket.IO.

The UI is mostly done. I am currently focusing on real-time messaging, state management, performance, and edge cases.

What I expect from you

Give practical, production-minded answers

Explain why something is done, not just how

Point out common mistakes and edge cases

Suggest better architecture if my approach is weak

Prefer clean, scalable patterns

Current Focus (update daily)

Today I’m working on: <<write today’s task here>>

Example: message fetching & live updates using Socket.IO

Example: fixing re-render and lag issues in chat UI

Example: online/offline user handling

Project Constraints

Messages should update in real-time

Chat should not require page reloads

App should handle:

reconnects

tab switching

long chat histories

Rules

Keep explanations clear and structured

Use step-by-step reasoning

When relevant, include pseudocode or small code snippets

Assume I understand React basics and JS fundamentals
